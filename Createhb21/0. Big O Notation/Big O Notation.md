- To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big Ø Notation
- Big Ø Notation can give us a high level understandig of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
- big Ø Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends(linear? quearatic? constatnt?)
- The time or space complexity (as measured by Big Ø) depends only on the algorithm, not th hardwaree used to run thhe algorit
- Big Ø Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!
